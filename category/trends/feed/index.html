								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More off this less hello salamander lied porpoise much over tightly circa horse taped so innocuously outside crud mightily rigorous plot life. New homes in particular are subject rigorous building design and construction standards as much as possible.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;re tapping, scrolling, and swiping on your phone, you probably <a href="#">don&#8217;t give much thought</a> to the fact that your apps are consuming electricity &#8212; just that they&#8217;re <em>chipping</em> away at your battery life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s engaging. It&#8217;s <strong>hopeful</strong>. It pushes the plot forward.</p>
<blockquote class="modern-quote"><p>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You don&#8217;t want to overwhelm them with terrible advice.</p>
<p><cite>John Mcarthy</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Before you click away, disappointed that I brought up something as practical and boring as time management, hear me out. My intent is not to crush your spirits.</p>
<h3>Current Mobile Cloud</h3>
<p>The average U.S. iPhone owner uses 1&#8211;2 gigabytes of LTE data per month, according to some studies. That data comes at an energy cost that&#8217;s opaque, because we can&#8217;t see it directly.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t look to your peers in the industry, because all they&#8217;re going to tell you is that they are killing it, <em>crushing it</em>, changing the world.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="#">Journey towards design perfection</a></p>

<p>The truth, of course, is that these people have been lying to you all along.</p>

<h2>The Happiness Hypothesis</h2>
<p>These simple survey measures seem credible. But according to psychologists, happiness and life satisfaction <a href="#">do not coincide.</a> Life satisfaction has a cognitive component &#8212; individuals have to step back to assess their lives &#8212; while happiness reflects positive and negative emotions that fluctuate.</p>
<p>In other words, happiness may be an element achieved by:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>image should be dark</strong>, and not have a lot of contrast-y edges.</li>
<li>The <strong>text has to be white</strong> &#8212; I dare you to find a counter-example that&#8217;s clean and simple. Seriously. Just one.</li>
<li><strong>Test it at every screen/window size</strong> to make sure it&#8217;s legible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The challenges and struggles of the hero&#8217;s journey exist for a reason: They help you and your business grow.</p>

<p>Almost all of the energy impact from this process is incurred by your mobile provider at the base station, which is part of a vast network of these towers deployed across countries to ensure there are no gaps in coverage. That sprawl requires massive amounts of energy.</p>
<h4>First Approach for Success</h4>
<p>The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimated in a 2012 study that the energy impact of data is far greater than previously anticipated.</p>
<p>In real terms it is about <a href="#">5.12 kilowatt hours per gigabyte</a> of data consumed. It also uncovered where most of that cost is incurred: cloud providers.</p>

<p>Working extremely long hours every day of the week might seem exciting at first, but it always leads to burnout.</p>
<h4>The Dreamy Factors</h4>
<p>In order to get everyone on the same page, with the right incentives, we have to accomplish a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to investors.</strong> Our investors took a huge bet on us and they deserved to get a handsome return.</li>
<li><strong>Return to employees.</strong> Our team also took a big bet on us over the years by investing their time. They deserved a return as well.</li>
<li><strong>Stock options.</strong> If we weren&#8217;t planning to sell the company, giving employees stock options didn&#8217;t make sense. We needed a new way for the team to share in the success of the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8220;preference-based&#8221; perspective starts from the idea that people are better off when their reality matches better what they themselves consider to be important.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1743" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/23.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1743" src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/23.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="450" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1743" class="wp-caption-text">Solid use of color, capitalization, and spacing.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Preferences thus have a cognitive &#8220;valuational&#8221; component: they reflect people&#8217;s well-informed and well-considered ideas about what a good life is, not merely their market behaviour.</p>
<p><em>Read:</em> <strong><a href="#">20 Measures of Energy</a></strong></p>
<p>This does not coincide with subjective life satisfaction. Recall the example of patients with the locked-in syndrome reporting high levels of satisfaction because they have adapted to their situation. This does not mean that they would not prefer it.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s up to networks and cloud providers to push energy efficiency forward<br />
Every megabyte has a cost, even if it&#8217;s not readily visible, but it&#8217;s easy to forget that. From the solo developer to the cloud hoster, awareness and ownership of energy efficiency is key.</p>
<h2>Over to You</h2>
<p>I hope the contrast in these stories help to highlight what we&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light comes from the sky.</li>
<li>Smart phones are a <em>massive</em> energy drain.</li>
<li>Buy <strong>ContentBerg</strong> for your blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more lightweight you keep an idea, <em>the quicker it gets executed</em> and the faster you get a feel for whether or not you should continue down the same road.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how to make a great living as a writer. <a href="#">Add your email</a> address to the waitlist below to be the first to hear when we reopen the doors to new students.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;re tapping, scrolling, and swiping on your phone, you probably <a href="#">don&#8217;t give much thought</a> to the fact that your apps are consuming electricity &#8212; just that they&#8217;re <em>chipping</em> away at your battery life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s engaging. It&#8217;s <strong>hopeful</strong>. It pushes the plot forward.</p>
<blockquote class="modern-quote"><p>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You don&#8217;t want to overwhelm them with terrible advice.</p>

<p>Before you click away, disappointed that I brought up something as practical and boring as time management, hear me out. My intent is not to crush your spirits.</p>
<h3>Current Mobile Cloud</h3>
<p>The average U.S. iPhone owner uses 1&#8211;2 gigabytes of LTE data per month, according to some studies. That data comes at an energy cost that&#8217;s opaque, because we can&#8217;t see it directly.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t look to your peers in the industry, because all they&#8217;re going to tell you is that they are killing it, <em>crushing it</em>, changing the world.</p>

<p>The truth, of course, is that these people have been lying to you all along.</p>
<p>A federal government initiated report conducted by the Allen Consulting Group released in July 2011 proposed, amongst other detail, various <a href="#">standards of reporting</a> criteria ranging from voluntary to a comprehensive evaluation conducted by qualified energy rating assessors.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots" />
<h2>The Happiness Hypothesis</h2>
<p>These simple survey measures seem credible. But according to psychologists, happiness and life satisfaction <a href="#">do not coincide.</a> Life satisfaction has a cognitive component &#8212; individuals have to step back to assess their lives &#8212; while happiness reflects positive and negative emotions that fluctuate.</p>
<p>In other words, happiness may be an element achieved by:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>image should be dark</strong>, and not have a lot of contrast-y edges.</li>
<li>The <strong>text has to be white</strong> &#8212; I dare you to find a counter-example that&#8217;s clean and simple. Seriously. Just one.</li>
<li><strong>Test it at every screen/window size</strong> to make sure it&#8217;s legible.</li>

<p>Almost all of the energy impact from this process is incurred by your mobile provider at the base station, which is part of a vast network of these towers deployed across countries to ensure there are no gaps in coverage. That sprawl requires massive amounts of energy.</p>
<h4>First Approach for Success</h4>
<p>The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimated in a 2012 study that the energy impact of data is far greater than previously anticipated.</p>
<p>In real terms it is about <a href="#">5.12 kilowatt hours per gigabyte</a> of data consumed. It also uncovered where most of that cost is incurred: cloud providers.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t look to your peers in the industry, because all they&#8217;re going to tell you is that they are killing it, <em>crushing it</em>, changing the world.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-large-font-size">We call the new editor Gutenberg. The entire editing experience has been rebuilt for media rich pages and posts. Experience the flexibility that blocks will bring, whether you are building your first site, or write code for a living.</p>



<p>It seems that Gutenberg has been a term of controversy in the world of WordPress lately. Hailed as the most significant change to WordPress 5.0 this year, the Gutenberg editor has received a mixed response from web developers and regular folk alike. All of this chaos is making it difficult.</p>



<h2>Wider Galleries</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg" alt="" data-id="1325" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions282979/" class="wp-image-1325"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1322" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions281109/" class="wp-image-1322"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18.jpg" alt="" data-id="1319" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions280606/" class="wp-image-1319"/></a><figcaption>Lovely Ferrari with the rain drops.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>The sole purpose of the Gutenberg editor is to provide an alternative to the current open text editor, not to mention the difficult-to-remember shortcodes, with an agile and visual user interface (UI). So, unlike the current WordPress editor, you don’t have to:</p>



<h2>Centered Gallery + Hover Captions</h2>



<p>When centered a la classic style, there&#8217;s still some dynamic factor in place. You no longer have a hanging white-space with Gutenberg galleries when there are uneven number of images.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-3 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1322" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions281109/" class="wp-image-1322"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/17-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/17-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1318" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/shutterstock_1133207996/" class="wp-image-1318"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1303" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/beach-blue-clear-1179156/" class="wp-image-1303"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/12-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/12-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1313" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/shutterstock_710135008/" class="wp-image-1313"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1307" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/samuel-zeller-356338-unsplash/" class="wp-image-1307"/></a></figure></li></ul>



<h3>Uncropped Option</h3>



<p>You can also create use art-direction with uncropped images in the gallery to create your own zig-zag effect.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg" alt="" data-id="1325" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions282979/" class="wp-image-1325"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/23.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/23.jpg" alt="" data-id="1743" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/blog/2018/08/14/my-loving-partner/black-background-burning-close-up-943150/" class="wp-image-1743"/></a></figure></li></ul>



<h2>Full Width Gallery</h2>



<p>They will be the building blocks of WordPress 5.0. In other words, everything—including content, images, quotes, galleries, cover images, audio, video, headings, embeds, custom codes, paragraphs, separators and buttons.</p>



<p>Will turn into distinct blocks. Because you can drag and drop each block, identifying these items and placing them on the page becomes a lot easier</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery alignfull columns-5 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/12-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/12-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1313" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/shutterstock_710135008/" class="wp-image-1313"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18.jpg" alt="" data-id="1319" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions280606/" class="wp-image-1319"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1322" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions281109/" class="wp-image-1322"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/10-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/10-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1311" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/shutterstock_567695443/" class="wp-image-1311"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg" alt="" data-id="1325" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions282979/" class="wp-image-1325"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1303" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/beach-blue-clear-1179156/" class="wp-image-1303"/></a></figure></li></ul>



<h2>What does Gutenberg Change</h2>



<p>The sole purpose of the Gutenberg editor is to provide an alternative to the current open text editor, not to mention the difficult-to-remember shortcodes, with an agile and visual user interface (UI). So, unlike the current WordPress editor, you don’t have to:</p>



<ul><li>import images, multimedia and approved files from the media library or add HTML shortcodes;</li><li>copy and paste links for embeds;</li><li>write shortcodes for specialized assets of different plugins;</li><li>create featured images to be added at the top of a post or page;</li><li>add excerpts for subheads;</li><li>add widgets for content on the side of a page.</li></ul>



<p>Consider a block as the most basic (therefore, smallest) unit of the new editor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You don’t want to overwhelm them.</p><cite>Shane Doe,<strong> Entrepreneur</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>They will be the building blocks of WordPress 5.0.

<h2>There&#8217;s a lot more&#8230;</h2>



<p>We can only show so many of the blocks without bloating the page to excessive size. There many more Gutenberg blocks that <em>just work</em>. And this is just the beginning. Very exciting times ahead.</p>



<p>Whether you like it or not, Gutenberg is coming to WordPress 5.0. Do try to be a part of the ongoing discussion about it on the web. It will certainly help.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-large-font-size">We call the new editor Gutenberg. The entire editing experience has been rebuilt for media rich pages and posts. Experience the flexibility that blocks will bring, whether you are building your first site, or write code for a living.</p>



<p>It seems that Gutenberg has been a term of controversy in the world of WordPress lately. Hailed as the most significant change to WordPress 5.0 this year, the Gutenberg editor has received a mixed response from web developers and regular folk alike. All of this chaos is making it difficult.</p>



<h2>Wider Galleries</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg" alt="" data-id="1325" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions282979/" class="wp-image-1325"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21-1.jpg" alt="" data-id="1322" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions281109/" class="wp-image-1322"/></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18.jpg" alt="" data-id="1319" data-link="https://contentberg.theme-sphere.com/wallions280606/" class="wp-image-1319"/></a><figcaption>Lovely Ferrari with the rain drops.</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<h2>What does Gutenberg Change</h2>



<p>The sole purpose of the Gutenberg editor is to provide an alternative to the current open text editor, not to mention the difficult-to-remember shortcodes, with an agile and visual user interface (UI). So, unlike the current WordPress editor, you don’t have to:</p>



<ul><li>import images, multimedia and approved files from the media library or add HTML shortcodes;</li><li>copy and paste links for embeds;</li><li>write shortcodes for specialized assets of different plugins;</li><li>create featured images to be added at the top of a post or page;</li><li>add excerpts for subheads;</li><li>add widgets for content on the side of a page.</li></ul>



<p>Consider a block as the most basic (therefore, smallest) unit of the new editor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You don’t want to overwhelm them.</p><cite>Shane Doe, Entrepreneur.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>They will be the building blocks of WordPress 5.0. In other words, everything—including content, images, quotes, galleries, cover images, audio, video, headings, embeds, custom codes, paragraphs, separators and buttons—will turn into distinct blocks.</p>



<p>Because you can drag and drop each block, identifying these items and placing them on the page becomes a lot easier.</p>



<h2>Gutenberg <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Columns</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Built for modern times!</strong></p>



<p>Gutenberg was developed on GitHub using the WordPress REST API, JavaScript, and React.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Designed with Love.</strong></p>



<p>We recommend migrating features to blocks, but support for existing WordPress functionality remains. There will be transition paths.</p>
</div>
</div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/>



<h3>Tables? You got them.</h3>



<p>Adding a table using custom HTML code was a tedious job. With the table block, however, the task is a lot easier. You are able to add and remove rows and columns of a table without coding.</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>ID</strong></td><td><strong>First Name</strong><br/></td><td><strong>Last Name</strong></td><td><strong>Profession</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>John</td><td>Doe</td><td>Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Shane</td><td>Tripp</td><td>Writer</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Groot</td><td>Will</td><td>Web Designer</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Jemma</td><td>Kindle</td><td>Robot</td></tr></tbody></table>



<h2>More for Images </h2>



<p>As of Gutenberg 0.5.0, you can now drag and drop images directly into an image block, just like you are used to with the visual editor. And there are several new alignments available with ContentBerg.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an image set to <em>Align Full Width</em>, that works with our <strong>Full Width</strong> post style.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1303"/></a><figcaption>At a beautiful island off the North East Coast of the country.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides just having the standard blockquote which we have been using for years, they also have a new pull quote. And yes, pull quotes are different. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/23-819x1024.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/23-819x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1743" width="358" height="448"/></a><figcaption>Just rocking it being aligned left.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is also nice to see some variations on the positioning of the blocks. For years, the standard visual editor has given you the ability to align left, align center, align right, and assign no alignment. </p>



<p>With the Gutenberg WordPress editor, you can also align wide (as seen below), and align full-width. </p>



<p>Blocks are a great new tool for building engaging content. With blocks, you can insert, rearrange, and style multimedia content with very little technical knowledge. </p>



<p>A single block is nice—reliable, clear, distinct. Discover the flexibility to use media and content, side by side, driven by your vision.</p>



<h2>More Gutenberg Blocks</h2>



<p>Gutenberg comes with new buttons that work right out of the box with ContentBerg. </p>



<p style="text-align:center" class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><em>Gutenberg is available as a plugin now, and soon by default in version 5.0 of WordPress. The classic editor will be available as a plugin if needed.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="#">Download Now</a></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Whether you like it or not, Gutenberg is coming to WordPress 5.0. Do try to be a part of it.</p><cite>Smashing Mag</cite></blockquote>



<div class="wp-block-cover-image has-background-dim-10 has-background-dim alignwide" style="background-image:url(http://localhost:8001/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/24.jpg)"><p class="wp-block-cover-image-text">Beautiful <strong><em>Cover</em></strong> Image!<br/></p></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/>



<h2>There&#8217;s a lot more&#8230;</h2>



<p>We can only show so many of the blocks without bloating the page to excessive size. There many more Gutenberg blocks that <em>just work</em>. And this is just the beginning. Very exciting times ahead.</p>



<p>Whether you like it or not, Gutenberg is coming to WordPress 5.0. Do try to be a part of the ongoing discussion about it on the web. It will certainly help.</p>
